Description: Implements sample size calculation and power methods for 
    three-level and stepped wedge cluster randomized trials, enabling 
    testing of heterogeneous treatment effects and average treatment 
    effects under various randomization levels and stepped wedge designs. 
    These methods are based on the frameworks proposed in two papers 
    entitled “Designing three-level cluster randomized trials to assess 
    treatment effect heterogeneity” and “Planning stepped wedge cluster 
    randomized trials to detect treatment effect heterogeneity” by Li et al.
